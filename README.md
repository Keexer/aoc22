Jacobs' solved solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

Includes a framework to list solved days, add new days, and give the user the functionality to run the solved days to get the result.

Since the software can build for differents platforms, the code expects that the build folder is at build/"OS".
So run cmake ../.. from the "OS" folder.
